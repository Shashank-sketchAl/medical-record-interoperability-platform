This project addresses the critical challenge of data fragmentation in healthcare by building an AI-powered platform for medical record interoperability. It aims to unify patient records from diverse hospital systems, providing a comprehensive and accessible view of patient health.

üéØ Objective
To develop a robust system that translates and unifies patient records from disparate healthcare providers using advanced Artificial Intelligence techniques, ultimately improving patient care and operational efficiency.

‚ú® Features
Universal EHR Conversion: Seamlessly convert Electronic Health Records (EHRs) from various formats, including HL7, FHIR, and XML, ensuring data compatibility across different systems.

Intelligent Data Extraction & Normalization: Utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) (powered by spaCy and scispaCy) to extract and normalize crucial medical data from unstructured and semi-structured records, transforming raw information into standardized, usable formats.

Intuitive Unified Timeline Visualization: Present a clear and concise unified timeline of treatments and visits, offering healthcare professionals and patients a holistic view of medical history.

Downloadable Structured Reports: Generate and provide downloadable structured reports that consolidate patient information, facilitating easier data sharing and analysis.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
Natural Language Processing (NLP): spaCy, scispaCy for advanced text processing and medical entity recognition.

API Integration: FHIR APIs for standardized healthcare data exchange and GraphQL for efficient data querying.

Database: MongoDB for flexible and scalable document-based storage of patient records.

Backend: Python Flask for a lightweight and powerful web framework.

Frontend: React for building a dynamic and responsive user interface.

üåü Impact
This platform has the potential for immense impact in solving real-world data fragmentation issues across healthcare systems. It's not only crucial for improving interoperability between hospitals but also highly beneficial for enhancing patient portals and streamlining telemedicine services, leading to better-informed decisions and improved patient outcomes.
